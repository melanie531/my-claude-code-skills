  Write science fiction novels and short stories with techniques derived from Liu Cixin's
  Remembrance of Earth's Past (Three-Body Problem) trilogy. Use when: (1) writing or outlining
  a sci-fi story, (2) building alien civilizations or cosmic-scale worldbuilding, (3) integrating
  real science into narrative fiction, (4) structuring multi-timeline or multi-era plots,
  (5) developing philosophical themes through speculative fiction, (6) writing hard sci-fi that
  remains emotionally engaging. NOT for: non-fiction writing, fantasy worldbuilding without
  scientific grounding, or literary fiction without speculative elements.

# Science Fiction Writing — Lessons from the Three-Body Problem

A practical framework for writing compelling science fiction, distilled from Liu Cixin's
masterwork and the techniques that made it a global phenomenon.

## Quick Start: The Five Pillars

1. **Concept First** — Start with a genuinely novel scientific or philosophical idea
2. **Scale as Character** — Let the universe's indifference be a source of tension
3. **Ground the Cosmic in the Personal** — Every galaxy-spanning idea needs a human heartbeat
4. **Logic-Driven Extrapolation** — Follow your premise to its most extreme logical conclusion
5. **Strategic Information Control** — What readers don't know drives the story forward

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Concept Development

1. Identify one core scientific/philosophical premise (the "big idea")
2. Apply the **Axiom Method**: define 2-3 unbreakable rules of your universe
3. Extrapolate consequences ruthlessly — follow the logic wherever it leads
4. Find where the premise creates impossible human dilemmas

See [references/science-integration.md](references/science-integration.md) for techniques on
turning real physics into narrative fuel.

### Phase 2: World Architecture

1. Build civilizations from constraints, not wish-fulfillment
2. Design technology that creates new problems, not just solutions
3. Use the **Civilization Ladder** to map power dynamics across species
4. Ensure the universe has consistent internal logic at every scale

See [references/worldbuilding.md](references/worldbuilding.md) for the complete worldbuilding
framework including the Dark Forest model.

### Phase 3: Narrative Structure

1. Choose your temporal architecture (single-era, epoch-spanning, or convergent timelines)
2. Deploy **strategic revelation** — each chapter should recontextualize what came before
3. Balance macro-plot (civilizational) with micro-plot (personal)
4. Use perspective shifts to show how the same events look at different scales

See [references/narrative-techniques.md](references/narrative-techniques.md) for structural
patterns and pacing strategies.

### Phase 4: Writing & Revision

1. Write science exposition as discovery, not lecture
2. Use concrete sensory details to anchor abstract concepts
3. Test every scene: does it serve both plot AND theme?
4. Ensure rising stakes operate at both personal and cosmic levels

## Key Techniques at a Glance

### The Axiom Method
Define your universe's fundamental laws the way Liu defined cosmic sociology:
- Axiom 1: Survival is the primary need of civilization
- Axiom 2: Civilization continuously grows, but total matter is constant

From just two axioms + two lemmas (chains of suspicion, technological explosion), the entire
Dark Forest theory emerges. Your story's universe should have similar foundational logic.

### The Scale Pivot
Alternate between intimate human moments and cosmic-scale events. Liu mastered this:
- A man buying a star for a woman he loves → that star becomes the key to humanity's survival
- A farmer's daughter during the Cultural Revolution → she decides the fate of two civilizations
- A woman's moment of compassion → dooms the Solar System

### Strategic Revelation (信息管控)
Control information flow like the Wallfacer Program:
- Hide your story's biggest ideas behind smaller, more immediate mysteries
- Each revelation should make the reader reassess everything they've read
- The best twists feel inevitable in retrospect

### The Technology Paradox
Every technological advance should create a new vulnerability:
- Sophons block scientific progress but reveal Trisolaran psychology
- Dark forest deterrence protects Earth but makes it a hostage
- Lightspeed drives enable escape but attract cosmic attention

## Genre Variants

| Style | Emphasis | Reference |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Hard SF | Scientific accuracy + extrapolation | science-integration.md |
| Space Opera | Civilizational conflict at cosmic scale | worldbuilding.md |
| First Contact | Communication barriers + alien psychology | worldbuilding.md |
| Philosophical SF | Ideas-driven with thought experiments | narrative-techniques.md |
| Military SF | Strategy under asymmetric constraints | worldbuilding.md |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **The Info Dump**: Don't explain science in paragraphs of exposition — embed it in action
- **Scale Without Stakes**: Cosmic events without personal consequences feel hollow
- **Convenient Technology**: Tech that solves problems without creating new ones kills tension
- **Anthropomorphic Aliens**: Truly alien minds should feel alien
- **Static Civilizations**: Societies change — especially under existential pressure
- **Resolved Tensions**: The best endings leave some philosophical questions unanswered
