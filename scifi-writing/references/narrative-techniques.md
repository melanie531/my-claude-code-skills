## Temporal Architecture {#temporal-architecture}

### Pattern 1: The Dual Timeline (Book 1)

```
Timeline A (Past):  ──────────────────→
Timeline B (Present): ──────────────────→
                      ↑ intersections  ↑
```

**How it works**: Two timelines run in parallel. The past explains motivations;
the present provides urgency. They intersect at key revelations.

**Best for**: Stories where the past directly shapes the present crisis.
Origin stories. Conspiracy narratives.

**Rules**:
- Each timeline must be compelling independently
- Switch timelines at moments of maximum tension (not resolution)
- The final intersection should recontextualize both timelines

### Pattern 2: The Epoch Novel (Book 3: Death's End)

```
Era 1 → [jump] → Era 2 → [jump] → Era 3 → [jump] → Era 4
         decades          centuries          millions of years
```

**How it works**: The story spans vast time periods with jumps between eras.
A "bridge character" (using hibernation, relativistic travel, etc.) provides continuity.

**Best for**: Stories about long-term consequences. Civilizational rise and fall.
The relationship between individual choices and cosmic outcomes.

**Rules**:
- Each era must feel like a different world
- The bridge character should be changed by each era they witness
- Accelerate the time jumps as the story progresses (this mirrors the
  reader's growing comfort with the technique)
- Use "era documents" (news excerpts, historical notes) as transitions

### Pattern 3: The Convergent Timeline

```
Thread A: ──────────→ ╲
Thread B: ──────────→  ╲→ [convergence point] → resolution
Thread C: ──────────→ ╱
```

**How it works**: Multiple independent storylines converge at a crisis point.
Each thread provides different knowledge needed to understand the convergence.

**Best for**: Complex plots with multiple factions. First contact scenarios.
War narratives where different perspectives reveal the full picture.

**Rules**:
- Each thread must withhold something the others reveal
- The convergence should be surprising but inevitable
- At least one thread should reframe the meaning of the others

### Pattern 4: The Nested Revelation

```
Surface story: ═══════════════════════════════→
Hidden layer 1:     ╔═══════════════╗
Hidden layer 2:          ╔════╗
Core truth:               ╔╗
```

**How it works**: The story has multiple layers of truth. Each revelation peels
back a layer, showing the previous understanding was incomplete.

**Best for**: Conspiracy stories. Stories about the nature of reality.
Any plot where "what you think is happening" is not what's actually happening.

**Liu's use**: The Three-Body game appears to be just a game → it's an ETO
recruitment tool → it's a model of Trisolaran reality → the Trisolarans are
coming → the universe itself is hostile.

## Point of View Management {#pov-management}

### The Protagonist Relay

Liu uses different protagonists for each book:
- Book 1: Wang Miao (scientist/detective)
- Book 2: Luo Ji (sociologist/reluctant hero)
- Book 3: Cheng Xin (engineer/moral center)

**Why it works**: Each protagonist is suited to their book's central question:
- Wang Miao can investigate (detective mindset)
- Luo Ji can strategize (game theory mindset)
- Cheng Xin can choose (moral dilemma mindset)

**Apply this**: Match your POV character's skills and psychology to the type of
story you're telling in each section. A character who's perfect for an investigation
may be wrong for a moral drama.

### The Scale-Shift POV

Liu occasionally shifts to a completely alien perspective:
- The "Singer" chapter in Death's End (an alien casually destroying star systems)
- The Trisolaran leader observing Earth
- The cosmic perspective in the epilogue

**Effect**: These shifts jolt the reader out of human-centric thinking. The
Singer sees destroying solar systems as routine maintenance — and that shift in
perspective is more terrifying than any battle scene.

**Use sparingly**: One or two alien POV sections per novel maximum. Their power
comes from contrast with the human perspective.

### Supporting Characters as Mirrors

Each protagonist has a foil who represents an alternative approach:
- Wang Miao ↔ Shi Qiang (intellectual vs. practical)
- Luo Ji ↔ Zhang Beihai (reluctant vs. determined)
- Cheng Xin ↔ Thomas Wade (compassionate vs. ruthless)

**The foil forces the protagonist to justify their choices**. Without Wade,
Cheng Xin's compassion has no dramatic cost. Without Shi Qiang, Wang Miao's
intellectual approach seems sufficient.

## Information Control & Strategic Revelation {#information-control}

### The Wallfacer Pattern

The Wallfacer concept from Book 2 is a narrative technique disguised as a plot element:
- Characters carry secrets the reader doesn't know
- The reader knows characters have secrets but not what they are
- Revelations come when secrets are decoded or exposed

**Apply this**: Give your characters information the reader lacks. Signal that
the information exists (don't blindside), but withhold its content. The tension
comes from knowing there's a secret, not from the secret itself.

### The Recontextualization Cascade

Each major revelation in the trilogy reframes everything before it:

1. Scientists are dying → the deaths are being *caused* (reframes from tragedy to conspiracy)
2. The Three-Body game is entertainment → it's a *recruitment tool* (reframes play as danger)
3. Earth is alone → Earth has been *watched for decades* (reframes safety as exposure)
4. Humanity can defend itself → a single probe *destroys the fleet* (reframes strength as hubris)
5. Deterrence works → deterrence fails *instantly* when Cheng Xin takes over (reframes
   security as illusion)
6. The universe is 3D → it was *originally 10D* and has been degraded by wars (reframes
   the universe itself as a battleground ruin)

**Structure your revelations** so each one forces the reader to re-evaluate what
they thought they understood. The best revelations don't just add information —
they change the meaning of existing information.

### The Planted Gun Technique

Liu plants details chapters or books before they become important:
- Luo Ji's conversation with Ye Wenjie about cosmic sociology → becomes the Dark Forest theory
- Yun Tianming buying a star for Cheng Xin → that star becomes her refuge
- The concept of dimensional physics → becomes the mechanism of solar system destruction

**Rule of Three**: Plant the detail. Remind of it in a different context. Deploy it
as a crucial plot element. By the third appearance, it feels both surprising and earned.

## Pacing at Scale {#pacing}

### The Tension Curve for Hard SF

Hard SF has a unique pacing challenge: you must explain science AND maintain tension.

```
     ↑ Tension
     |        ╱╲        ╱╲         ╱╲ CLIMAX
     |      ╱╱  ╲╲    ╱╱  ╲╲     ╱╱
     |    ╱╱ sci ╲╲ ╱╱ sci ╲╲  ╱╱
     |  ╱╱  expo  ╲╲  expo  ╲╲╱╱
     | ╱    sition    sition
     └────────────────────────────→ Time
```

**Pattern**: Alternate between science exposition (lower tension but building
understanding) and dramatic scenes (high tension, using the science). Never
explain science in high-tension moments — the reader should already understand
the mechanism before it's deployed.

### The Countdown Structure

Liu uses explicit and implicit countdowns to drive urgency:
- **Explicit**: The Trisolaran fleet arrives in 450 years
- **Implicit**: How long until the Dark Forest strike on Earth?

**Create multiple overlapping countdowns at different scales**:
- Immediate: "We have hours before the probe reaches the fleet"
- Medium: "We have decades before the fleet arrives"
- Long: "We have an unknown time before the universe ends"

Each scale of countdown creates tension at a different frequency, keeping
the reader perpetually anxious.

### Pacing Across Eras

When spanning long time periods:
1. **Compress the boring parts**: "200 years of relative peace" gets a paragraph
2. **Expand the crisis moments**: A single day of crisis gets an entire chapter
3. **Use the gap productively**: When the reader jumps forward, show that
   everything they assumed about the future was wrong
4. **Accelerate toward the end**: Each era should be shorter than the last

## The Opening {#the-opening}

### Liu's Opening Strategy

The Three-Body Problem opens with the Cultural Revolution — a real, documented
historical horror. No aliens. No spaceships. Just a woman watching her father
beaten to death.

**Why it works**:
1. Grounds the reader in emotional reality before introducing the fantastic
2. Establishes that this story is about human nature first, aliens second
3. Creates a "trust contract" — the author respects the reader enough to
   start with truth
4. Provides the psychological foundation for everything that follows

### Opening Patterns for Sci-Fi

**Pattern A: Ground-First** (Liu's method)
- Open with recognizable human reality
- Introduce speculative elements gradually
- Best for: hard SF, first contact, near-future

**Pattern B: Disorientation-First**
- Open in the alien/future world with no explanation
- Let the reader piece together context from clues
- Best for: far-future, alien POV, post-human

**Pattern C: The Hook Question**
- Open with a scene that raises an impossible question
- "Why are the world's top physicists killing themselves?"
- Best for: mystery-SF hybrids, thriller-paced SF

**Pattern D: The Cosmic Zoom**
- Start at cosmic scale, zoom into the personal
- "The universe is 13.8 billion years old. This story is about Tuesday."
- Best for: stories about scale, perspective, humanity's place in the cosmos

## The Ending {#the-ending}

### Liu's Ending Philosophy

The trilogy ends not with victory or defeat, but with a choice:
- Cheng Xin can stay in her mini-universe (safe, but selfish)
- Or return its mass to the dying universe (selfless, but uncertain)
- She chooses to give it back, leaving a small terrarium of Earth life
- The universe's fate is unknown

**This works because**:
1. It resolves the character arc (Cheng Xin finally makes a choice that costs her)
2. It doesn't resolve the philosophical question (is the universe worth saving?)
3. It ends on an image (a small ecological sphere, drifting in cosmos) not an answer
4. It mirrors the trilogy's theme: small acts of faith in an indifferent universe

### Ending Patterns for Sci-Fi

**The Open Question**: End with the thematic question unanswered (Liu's method)
- Pro: Respects reader intelligence, generates lasting discussion
- Con: Can feel unresolved if the narrative arc isn't complete

**The Pyrrhic Victory**: The goal is achieved, but at devastating cost
- Pro: Satisfying plot resolution with emotional weight
- Con: Can feel formulaic if the cost is predictable

**The Perspective Shift**: In the final scene, zoom out to show the story's
events from a radically different scale or viewpoint
- Pro: Recontextualizes everything; powerful for cosmic SF
- Con: Can make the human story feel insignificant if not handled carefully

**The Return**: After the cosmic journey, return to something small and human
- Pro: Provides emotional grounding after epic events
- Con: Can feel anticlimactic if the small moment isn't earned

## Dialogue in Hard SF {#dialogue}

### The Exposition Dialogue Trap

Hard SF requires explaining complex concepts. The temptation is to have
characters explain science to each other in dialogue. This usually fails.

**Liu's solutions**:

1. **The Unequal Knowledge Dialogue**: One character knows; the other
   asks questions the reader also has. (Wang Miao and Shi Qiang)

2. **The Debate**: Characters disagree about implications of known science.
   The science gets explained through the argument. (Wallfacer hearings)

3. **The Discovery Moment**: A character figures something out in real-time.
   The reader follows their reasoning. (Luo Ji developing the Dark Forest theory)

4. **The Game**: Science is embedded in a narrative frame (the Three-Body
   VR game). The reader learns through play, not lecture.

### Dialogue Character Voices

In hard SF, there's a risk of all characters sounding like professors.
Liu differentiates through:
- **Shi Qiang**: Colloquial, blunt, practical ("That's bullshit and you know it")
- **Ye Wenjie**: Measured, melancholic, precise
- **Luo Ji**: Initially flippant, gradually weighted
- **Cheng Xin**: Empathetic, sometimes naive, always sincere
- **Thomas Wade**: Clipped, cold, focused on action

## Scene Construction Patterns {#scene-patterns}

### The Reversal Scene

Liu's most powerful scenes follow this structure:
1. Establish expectation (humanity's fleet is magnificent)
2. Build confidence (characters express hope/pride)
3. Introduce the disruption (the Waterdrop approaches)
4. The reversal (total annihilation in minutes)
5. Aftermath (silence, shock, recalibration)

**Key**: The longer you build expectation, the more devastating the reversal.
The Doomsday Battle works because Liu spends chapters building humanity's
confidence before destroying it in pages.

### The Quiet Revelation Scene

Not all revelations need action. Some of Liu's best moments are quiet:
- Ye Wenjie receiving the Trisolaran warning message — alone at her console
- Luo Ji understanding the Dark Forest — lying in the snow, staring at stars
- The Singer casually selecting Earth's solar system for destruction — routine

**Structure**: Character alone or in intimate setting → thought process →
realization → silence. Let the weight of the idea fill the scene.

### The Beautiful Destruction Scene

When depicting catastrophe, Liu writes it as aesthetic experience:
- Sensory details focus on beauty, not horror
- Technical description mixed with emotional response
- The destruction unfolds slowly enough to be witnessed
- Characters observe with a mix of terror and awe

**Example approach**:
```
Wrong: "The fleet exploded in a massive fireball."
Right: "The ships came apart like flowers blooming in fast-forward,
each one briefly beautiful before it was gone."
```

### The Moral Dilemma Scene

When a character faces an impossible choice:
1. Establish both options clearly
2. Show why each option has merit AND cost
3. Give the character time to struggle (don't rush)
4. Make the choice — and immediately show consequences
5. Never let the narrative declare which choice was "right"

Liu's mastery: Cheng Xin's decision not to activate deterrence is presented
so that the reader understands both why she couldn't do it AND why it was
catastrophic. The novel refuses to resolve this tension.
